* Droid DatePicker

This is a project with some interfaces do input mainly numerical data on
android.

It first contains a DatePicker and a TimePicker that helps to fasten the input
of these values on Android.

I've seen many of them and choose the format based on simplicity and ease to
use. 

The design of the TimePicker was based on BussinessCalendar
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mikado.bizcalpro) time picker.


** Date and Time Formats

Actually, the code only supports 24h time format and European (dd/MM/YYYY) date
format for simplicity.
